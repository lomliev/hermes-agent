# SkyAI Customer Plugin

SkyAI Customer is the first clean-room SkyVision customer-facing Hermes v2
plugin. It is intentionally narrow and public-safe:

- search SkyVision public catalog cache;
- fetch public product detail by URL/path;
- fetch public product slots by product id;
- append sanitized local/dev events for an append-only customer intelligence
  spine.

It does **not** include DevOps, Git, Render, GCP admin, Shopify admin, Muncho
brain, raw customer database, payments, voucher lookup, order lookup, or write
actions.

## Architecture Contract

Read `ARCHITECTURE.md` before changing this plugin. The top-level rule is:
Hermes reasons; this backend provides public facts, structured evidence,
transport, cards, and safety boundaries. Do not add keyword routers,
customer-visible template logic, or one-off phrase guards around Hermes.

## Behavior Versioning

SkyAI has two version markers:

- `version` is the technical runtime line, for example `skyai-hermes-v2.canary`.
- `behavior_version` is the customer-facing behavior line, for example `v2.2`.

Increase `behavior_version` only for meaningful behavior changes: new customer
knowledge domains, sales/support policy changes, prompt architecture changes,
voice behavior changes, or changes that affect what customers see/hear. Do not
increase it for formatting-only fixes, tests, refactors, logging, deployment
wiring, or typo-only patches.

Current line:

- `v2.0` - initial SkyAI Hermes v2 canary baseline.
- `v2.1` - BookNow/checkout completion boundary, voice handoff behavior, and
  recent customer-safe business knowledge refinements.
- `v2.2` - catalog selection context for broad searches: Hermes receives
  diverse evidence ordering, category mix, and repeated-category signals
  without backend pruning or keyword routing.
- `v2.3` - campaign gift entitlement knowledge: gifts/bonuses are not manual
  voucher-code entries; they link automatically through logged-in orders or the
  order email.
- `v2.4` - campaign bonus transfer nuance: the bonus stays linked to the buyer
  by default, while founder-approved human exceptions may use Emil's public
  phone and SkyVision's founding flight story.
- `v2.5` - session continuity: Hermes treats prior turns as shared context,
  checks its draft against its own earlier answers, removes unnecessary
  repetition, and repeats earlier details only when the customer explicitly
  asks or prior information must be corrected. No backend deduplication or
  keyword guard is added.
- `v2.6` - voucher issuer boundary: before giving account, activation, or
  redemption steps, Hermes reasons about who issued the voucher. SkyVision
  profile flows apply only to SkyVision-issued vouchers; externally issued
  vouchers remain under their issuer even when the same experience is listed
  by SkyVision. No brand-specific classifier or router is added.
- `v2.7` - contextual voucher and contact judgment: an unspecified voucher in a
  SkyVision conversation is normally treated as SkyVision-issued, while Hermes
  asks about the issuer only when the conversation creates a concrete
  compatibility doubt. Written customer contact uses `info@skyvision.bg`;
  `reservations@skyvision.bg` remains an automated notification sender, not a
  reply channel. No issuer classifier, keyword guard, or contact router is
  added.
- `v2.8` - campaign-gift time and validity reasoning: receipt of the main
  voucher is not treated as the purchase or entitlement-creation date; Hermes
  checks historical campaign terms, separate validity, use state, and current
  usability before ownership, transfer, exception, or escalation guidance.
  Missing evidence permits only a possible-expiry statement and a lookup, not
  an expiry fact or promised exception. No runtime status classifier, phrase
  matcher, or response guard is added.
- `v2.9` - service-specific reservation cancellation policy reasoning: Hermes
  uses exact service context plus the existing public product-detail tool to
  refresh current structured `cancellationPolicy` facts by canonical slug. The
  structured field has precedence over product prose; missing/fetch-failed
  detail stays unverified. No universal cancellation-hour constant, classifier,
  router, or customer-answer template is added.
- `v2.10` - reservation-path and escalation judgment: ordinary reservations
  default to the voucher context, while rare BookNow is used only when explicit
  or clearly evidenced; date/time, payment, top-up, or confirmation alone do
  not prove it. Redeeming a gifted voucher and paying a difference creates no
  new campaign bonus, which remains linked to the original buyer. Hermes gives
  `info@skyvision.bg` only for requested contact or a reported unresolved case
  requiring human action, never as a speculative standard closing. These are
  prompt, public-facts, and evaluation principles without keyword routing or
  answer post-processing.

## Canonical Source

This plugin in `lomliev/hermes-agent` is the only source for future SkyAI
customer behavior. The former standalone repository
`lomliev/skyvision-hermes-ai-assistant` is a read-only historical archive and
must not receive new prompt, knowledge, evaluation, voice-brain, or deployment
work.

The `skyai_v1_chatkit` voice target is retained only as a wire-compatibility
label for historical DEV comparison. It is not a second business brain and
does not make the archived repository a runtime source for SkyAI v2.

## Voice Contract

Future PBX/voice work is documented in `docs/skyai-voice-contract-v0.1.md`.
That contract keeps telephony concerns in a separate SkyAI Voice Gateway and
keeps this plugin as the public-safe customer knowledge/tool layer. The DEV
gateway exposes HTTP transcript/event adapter endpoints under `/voice/*`; it
does not include SIP, STT, TTS, RTP, PBX configuration, or production routing.

## Intended Runtime Boundary

Customer-facing Hermes may call this plugin. Muncho remains the internal
operator/supervisor and may observe sanitized reports, but SkyAI customer
memory must not be written into Muncho canonical brain.

## Event Log

`skyai_event_log_append` writes local JSONL by default:

```text
$HERMES_HOME/skyai_v2/events.jsonl
```

This is only a development stand-in. Production should move to a dedicated
Cloud SQL schema such as `skyai_ci.events` with append-only insert privileges.
Do not enable a generic `DATABASE_URL` fallback for SkyAI customer
intelligence.

## DEV Canary Gateway

Bootstrap the dedicated SkyAI v2 DEV profile. Use `--inherit-model-config`
when the root Hermes config exists; it copies only non-secret provider/model
fields. VM canaries may pass the same non-secret fields explicitly:

```bash
python scripts/skyai_v2_bootstrap_dev_profile.py \
  --apply \
  --inherit-model-config \
  --model-default gpt-5.6-sol \
  --model-provider openai-codex \
  --model-base-url https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex \
  --model-api-mode codex_responses
```

Start the FAB-compatible canary surface in dry-run mode:

```bash
python -m plugins.skyai_customer.dev_gateway \
  --dev \
  --profile-home ~/.hermes/profiles/skyai-v2-dev
```

Smoke it locally:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/chatkit/dev-message \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"conversation_id":"dev-smoke","message":"Здравей, търся подарък за двама"}'
```

Dry-run is the default. Calling the live Hermes model requires the explicit
`--live-model` flag. Private RFC1918 binds still require `--allow-public-bind`;
public or wildcard binds also require a bearer token from
`SKYAI_V2_CANARY_TOKEN`.

Voice adapter smoke can be simulated without audio:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/voice/turn \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"call_id":"call-dev-1","conversation_id":"voice-dev-1","transcript":"Търся подарък за рожден ден.","is_final":true,"stt_confidence":0.95}'
```

For a fuller no-audio contract smoke across `/voice/start`, `/voice/turn`,
`/voice/event`, and `/voice/end`, use the DEV helper:

```bash
python scripts/skyai_voice_contract_smoke.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8787 \
  --backend-target skyai_v2_chatkit
```

Against a private/GCP DEV endpoint, pass the endpoint and keep the bearer token
in the configured environment variable rather than on the command line:

```bash
SKYAI_V2_CANARY_TOKEN=... \
python scripts/skyai_voice_contract_smoke.py \
  --base-url https://<dev-skyai-endpoint> \
  --token-env SKYAI_V2_CANARY_TOKEN \
  --backend-target skyai_v2_chatkit
```

## DEV OpenAI Audio Preflight

The approved voice MVP keeps SkyAI reasoning on the Hermes/Codex OAuth lane and
uses OpenAI API only for STT/TTS in the media gateway. Configure the audio
secret on the DEV gateway host only:

```text
VOICE_TOOLS_OPENAI_KEY
```

Then verify the non-secret setup without calling OpenAI or printing the key:

```bash
python scripts/skyai_voice_openai_audio_preflight.py --require-key
```

Initial audio candidates are `gpt-4o-transcribe`,
`gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-mini-tts`, and the voice candidates
documented in `docs/skyai-voice-contract-v0.1.md`.

For the approved low-latency canary, validate the Realtime configuration
separately. This does not call OpenAI, open a WebSocket, process audio, touch
PBX/SIP/RTP, or print secrets:

```bash
python scripts/skyai_voice_openai_realtime_preflight.py --require-key
```

Realtime voice uses OpenAI for the live audio loop and keeps SkyAI v2 as the
Hermes knowledge/tool brain. Gateway-owned repeated filler phrases are not
allowed in this lane; any short spoken bridge while tools run must be
contextual and model-owned.

Voice calls are mirrored by the same DEV Discord sidecar when
`SKYAI_DISCORD_MIRROR_ENABLED=true` and
`SKYAI_DISCORD_MIRROR_CHANNEL_ID=1510888721614901358` are configured. The
voice mirror is an operational side effect of `/voice/start`, `/voice/turn`,
`/voice/event`, and `/voice/end`; it is not a model tool. DEV voice threads are
marked with `🎙️` and `🧪 TEST` unless the gateway explicitly marks a future
production call as real/customer.
