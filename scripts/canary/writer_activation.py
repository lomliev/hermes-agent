"""Compatibility entrypoint for the packaged writer-only canary planner.

All planning and staging contracts live in ``gateway.canonical_writer_planner``
so the exact same reviewed implementation runs from a sealed wheel under
``python -B -I``.  This source-tree module intentionally contains no alternate
preview, routing, approval, or deployment logic.
