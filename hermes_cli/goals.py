"""Persistent session goals — the Ralph loop for Hermes.

A goal is a free-form user objective that stays active across turns. The
primary model records its structured outcome through the todo tool. Hermes
then continues mechanically until that model reports verified completion,
an optional owner-configured turn budget is exhausted, or the user
pauses/clears the goal. A budget of ``0`` means no automatic cross-turn
pause; per-turn model, tool, permission, and resource boundaries still apply.

State is persisted in SessionDB's ``state_meta`` table keyed by
``goal:<session_id>`` so ``/resume`` picks it up.

Design notes / invariants:

- The continuation prompt is just a normal user message appended to the
  session via ``run_conversation``. No system-prompt mutation, no toolset
  swap — prompt caching stays intact.
- Missing model-authored outcome state is fail-OPEN to ``continue``. Runtime
  bookkeeping must never infer completion from response text.
- When a real user message arrives mid-loop it preempts the continuation
  prompt. The primary model can record the new structured outcome in that
  same turn.
- This module has zero hard dependency on ``cli.HermesCLI`` or the gateway
  runner — both wire the same ``GoalManager`` in.

Nothing in this module touches the agent's system prompt or toolset.

    """Drive a kanban worker through a Ralph-style goal loop.

    The dispatcher spawns a goal-mode worker exactly like a normal worker
    (``hermes -p <profile> chat -q "work kanban task <id>"``). The worker's
    first turn has already run by the time this is called; ``first_response``
    is that turn's reply. From here we:

    1. Check whether the worker already terminated the task (called
       ``kanban_complete`` / ``kanban_block``). If so, stop — nothing to do.
    2. Otherwise feed a continuation prompt and run another turn IN THE SAME
       SESSION via ``run_turn``. Only the primary worker can close or block
       the task through its structured lifecycle tools.
    3. When the turn budget is exhausted and the worker still hasn't
       terminated the task, ``block_fn`` is invoked so the card lands in a
       sticky ``blocked`` state for human review (NOT a silent exit).

    This function performs NO SessionDB persistence — a worker process is
    ephemeral, so the turn budget lives in a local counter. It is fully
    decoupled from the CLI for testability: callers inject ``run_turn``
    (str -> str), ``task_status_fn`` (() -> str|None), and ``block_fn``
    (reason: str -> None).

    Returns a decision dict: ``{"outcome", "turns_used", "reason"}`` where
    outcome is one of ``"completed_by_worker"``, ``"blocked_budget"``,
    ``"blocked_by_worker"``, or ``"stopped"``.
