"""Exact, owner-approved production legacy-truth cutover coordinator.

The isolated-canary foundation deliberately refuses the production database.
This module does not weaken that boundary and does not contain a second SQL or
systemd implementation.  It composes four already-sealed mechanical edges:

* an exact service boundary for ``hermes-cloud-gateway.service`` and the
  Canonical Writer unit;
* a read-only legacy snapshot collector;
* an atomic database apply/rollback boundary; and
* an activation apply/rollback boundary.

There is one owner-approved authority before production is stopped.  It binds
the exact release, target, artifacts, host transition, capability collector
criteria, final-tail bounds, and rollback.  The final tail and dynamic
PID/socket readiness receipt are derived mechanically after that approval;
neither can be guessed or pre-signed.  No credential or secret value is
accepted by any public schema.
