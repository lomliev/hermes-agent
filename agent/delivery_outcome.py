"""Turn-bound, primary-model-authored delivery outcomes.

The model may use the existing ``todo`` tool to choose whether the completed
turn should be delivered to a messaging surface.  This module deliberately
does not inspect response text.  It only validates the small structured
protocol, binds it to the turn that authored it, and returns a receipt.

The state is agent-local and reset at every turn boundary.  A late tool worker
from an earlier turn therefore cannot suppress a newer turn.
