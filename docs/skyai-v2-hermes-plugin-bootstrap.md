# SkyAI Hermes v2 Plugin Bootstrap

Date: 2026-07-03

## Current Canonical Status

As of 2026-07-24, SkyAI v2 is the production customer assistant and this
plugin worktree is the only canonical source for future SkyAI behavior.
Production health reports the Hermes runtime with the `skyai_customer` toolset.

The former standalone repository `lomliev/skyvision-hermes-ai-assistant` is a
read-only historical v1/clean-room archive. Its separate `skyai_v1` DEV ingress
may remain temporarily available as frozen comparison evidence, but it is not
the production source and must not receive new behavior or deployment work.
See `docs/skyai-v1-legacy-archive.md`.

## Decision

SkyAI v2 starts as a plugin/skills layer on top of clean upstream Hermes
(`NousResearch/hermes-agent`) rather than a fork that patches core files.

This keeps daily upstream sync small:

- upstream Hermes changes are merged into a clean base;
- SkyAI changes stay in `plugins/skyai_customer/`, skills, config, tests, and
  external services;
- customer-facing runtime has no Muncho/admin/DevOps capabilities.

## Initial Capability Slice

The first slice adds:

- public catalog search tool;
- public product detail tool;
- public product slots tool;
- curated public campaign knowledge tool;
- Discord mirror v2 sidecar for canary conversations;
- DEV-only comparison endpoint for SkyAI v2 canary vs current PROD SkyAI;
- sanitized local append-only event stub;
- dedicated `skyai-v2-dev` profile bootstrap script;
- DEV-only FAB-compatible canary endpoint;
- operator skill describing SkyAI v2 boundaries, tone, BookNow/campaign
  knowledge, and learning loop.

## Not In This Gate

- No PROD traffic switch.
- No Cloud SQL provisioning.
- No Redis provisioning.
- No Discord bot permission changes in code; mirror activates only when the
  DEV runtime is configured with a bot token and channel id.
- No customer/order/payment/voucher mutation.
- No Muncho canonical brain writes.

## Next Gates

1. Enable the plugin in a dedicated SkyAI v2 Hermes profile.
2. Run the DEV canary gateway locally or behind a DEV-only ingress.
3. Add Cloud SQL `skyai_ci.events` insert-only backend behind explicit
   `SKYAI_CI_DATABASE_URL` / `SKYAI_CI_EVENT_WRITE_ENABLED` gates.
4. Mirror every canary thread to the SkyAI Discord channel.
5. Run side-by-side live canary through `/qa/compare` with instant rollback to
   current PROD SkyAI.

## DEV Canary Bootstrap

```bash
python scripts/skyai_v2_bootstrap_dev_profile.py \
  --apply \
  --inherit-model-config \
  --model-default gpt-5.6-sol \
  --model-provider openai-codex \
  --model-base-url https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex \
  --model-api-mode codex_responses
python -m plugins.skyai_customer.dev_gateway \
  --dev \
  --profile-home ~/.hermes/profiles/skyai-v2-dev
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/chatkit/dev-message \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"conversation_id":"dev-smoke","message":"Здравей, търся подарък за двама"}'
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/qa/compare \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"conversation_id":"compare-smoke","message":"Има ли масаж в София?"}'
```

The canary gateway is loopback/dry-run by default. Live model calls require
`--live-model`. Private RFC1918 binds still require `--allow-public-bind`;
public or wildcard binds also require an explicit token gate.

Optional DEV-only environment gates:

- `SKYAI_DISCORD_MIRROR_ENABLED=true`
- `SKYAI_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...` or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=...`
- `SKYAI_DISCORD_MIRROR_CHANNEL_ID=1510888721614901358`
- `SKYAI_DISCORD_MIRROR_CREATE_THREADS=true`
- `SKYAI_COMPARE_PROD_BASE_URL=https://<current-prod-skyai>`

The Discord mirror and comparison endpoint are gateway sidecars, not model
tools. The customer-facing Hermes model cannot call Discord, mutate PROD, or
read internal reports.

Voice sessions use the same Discord mirror sidecar and channel while the PBX
MVP is in DEV. Voice threads are intentionally marked separately, for example
`🧪 TEST · 🎙️ Voice SkyAI · <conversation_id>`, so web/FAB and voice evidence
can live in `1510888721614901358` without being confused.

## Three-Hour Upstream Sync Policy

The deterministic upstream-sync rail is documented in
`docs/skyai-v2-upstream-sync-automation.md`. Its default mode is read-only:

```bash
python3 scripts/skyai_v2_upstream_sync_routine.py
```

The scheduled mode may build/test and push one fork-only candidate PR:

```bash
python3 scripts/skyai_v2_upstream_sync_routine.py --execute --push-pr
```

It runs every three hours and never auto-merges or deploys. For a manual
verification after fetching `NousResearch/hermes-agent`:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
python scripts/skyai_v2_upstream_sync_check.py origin/main
scripts/run_tests.sh \
  tests/plugins/test_skyai_customer_plugin.py \
  tests/plugins/test_skyai_customer_schema.py \
  tests/plugins/test_skyai_customer_dev_gateway.py \
  tests/scripts/test_skyai_v2_bootstrap_dev_profile.py \
  tests/scripts/test_skyai_v2_upstream_sync_check.py \
  -q
git diff --check
rg -n "^(<<<<<<<|>>>>>>>)" -S . -g '!node_modules' -g '!venv' -g '!.venv'
```

The sync check must stay green before any DEV or PROD canary work. If it fails,
SkyAI v2 has started touching Hermes core and needs a separate architecture
review before merge.

The recurring rail also stops on dirty canonical state, unknown merge
conflicts, concurrent execution, or any failed SkyAI/voice/architecture/schema
test. Runtime deployment remains a separate explicit gate.
