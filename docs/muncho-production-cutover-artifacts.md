# Muncho production cutover artifacts

The production legacy-truth coordinator never executes loose SQL, imports a
mutable release module, or inherits an operator environment.  Every immutable
release now contains six generated, self-contained mechanical executables:

| Artifact | Accepted actions |
| --- | --- |
| `production-observe` | `observe_initial`, `observe_final_tail`, `observe_before_apply` |
| `production-database-apply` | `database_apply` |
| `production-database-rollback` | `database_rollback` |
| `production-database-postflight` | `database_preflight`, `database_terminal` |
| `production-host-activation` | `host_apply_stopped`, `host_start_prerequisites`, `host_start_writer`, `host_commit_boot` |
| `production-host-rollback` | `host_rollback` |

They are generated under
`ops/muncho/cutover/artifacts/` while the release is still staged. The deploy
helper verifies the canonical `manifest.json` before the release can become a
deployment target. Each executable embeds its disjoint action allowlist, the
reviewed legacy reconciliation SQL, and the reviewed Canonical Writer SQL.
There is no runtime import from the mutable checkout. The manifest records the
source and executable SHA-256 digests, sizes, actions, exact release revision,
and its own digest. The source set also binds the reviewed privileged Discord
connector unit template, gateway `BindsTo`/Relay drop-in, and connector config
template. The rendered live host bytes are separately bound by the signed
`host_transition` manifest because their release SHA, numeric service IDs, and
exact Discord guild/root-channel ACL allowlist are production inputs rather
than build-time facts.
Its `plan_bindings` object is already in the coordinator's exact
`{path, sha256}` shape for `observe`, `database_apply`,
`database_rollback`, `database_postflight`, `host_activation`, and
`host_rollback`; operators do not transcribe or recompute those values.

## Approval binding

The freeze plan binds the exact `production-observe` path and digest. The
cutover plan separately binds all six logical artifact slots. The coordinator
copies the approved bytes into its root-owned plan journal before execution.
The child then independently verifies:

- canonical request and plan self-digests;
- exact release revision and target fields;
- its own bytes against the applicable plan artifact SHA-256;
- its action against the action allowlist sealed into those bytes;
- the final stopped-tail row, content, relation/OID/owner, ACL, and index
  identities;
- an empty inherited environment and root/Linux execution identity; and
- absence of secret material from every response schema.

The owner must use the manifest paths and digests exactly when constructing the
freeze and cutover plans. A PR approval, canary receipt, manifest, or old chat
approval is not production mutation authority. The final signed approval is
issued only after the stopped final-tail receipt and the resulting exact plan
digest exist.

## OS Login pre-cutover gate

The production cutover transport intentionally refuses IAP/SSH unless the exact
production instance has `enable-oslogin=TRUE`, has no instance-level
`ssh-keys`, and the pinned owner profile contains the expected POSIX identity
and public key. A separate owner-signed metadata migration gate handles the
one-time transition; it is not folded into the cutover state machine.

Before its first metadata write, the gate binds and re-reads the exact project,
zone, instance ID, metadata fingerprint, project metadata fingerprint, owner
profile/key, and effective IAM decisions for instance read, metadata update,
OS Admin Login, and IAP tunnel access. Its only forward operations are setting
`enable-oslogin=TRUE` and removing the single instance `ssh-keys` entry. It
then reads the full metadata state back, proves unrelated metadata unchanged,
and runs the fixed `/usr/bin/true` probe through pinned IAP/OS Login. If any
mutation or access proof fails, it restores the exact prior `ssh-keys` value
and prior `enable-oslogin` state and verifies the full metadata map again. No
caller-supplied remote command or owner private key crosses the transport.

The fixed owner actions are deliberately split so the signed authority can be
reviewed before the metadata mutation:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  os-login-preflight \
  --revision <exact-40-char-release-sha> \
  --owner-private-key "$HOME/.ssh/skyvision_mac_ops_ed25519" \
  --output /absolute/owner/path/os-login-authority.json

python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  os-login-migrate \
  --revision <same-exact-release-sha> \
  --authority /absolute/owner/path/os-login-authority.json \
  --output /absolute/owner/path/os-login-receipt.json
```

The first action is Cloud read-only and accepts the existing unencrypted
Ed25519 OpenSSH owner key locally. The second action accepts only that exact,
self-hashed, signed authority bundle. Both actions reconstruct the production
transport from the release-pinned owner runtime and verify the launcher and OS
Login module against the same commit. The private key is neither printed nor
staged.

## Database boundary

Observe and postflight run serializable read-only transactions under the same
global advisory lock used by the writer migration. They connect only to the
plan's exact IP, verified TLS server name, database, port, and frozen source
owner. The CA and password transport live at fixed root-only paths:

- `/etc/muncho-production-cutover/cloudsql-server-ca.pem` (`0400` or `0444`);
- `/etc/muncho-production-cutover/pgpass` (`0400`).

Neither value, its digest, subprocess output, SQL text, nor database error text
is returned or journaled. Before database apply, the artifact performs a fresh
verified-TLS startup probe to the managed `cloudsqladmin` database and requires
the exact SQLSTATE `28000` HBA rejection. Only that fresh receipt digest is
injected into the writer transaction.

Database apply is resumable across three independently idempotent states:
legacy nineteen-column truth, reconciled fourteen-column truth with the moved
archive, and terminal Canonical Writer schema plus exact writer membership.
Every entry rechecks the signed final snapshot. Database rollback is a separate
artifact. It is permitted only while both the canonical table and archive still
match the approved frozen truth and writer provenance contains zero rows. It
then restores the original relation object (and therefore its OID, owner, ACL,
indexes, defaults, and five legacy columns) rather than reconstructing it.

## Host and privileged Discord boundary

Before the owner signs the cutover plan, every reviewed host target is staged as
root-owned mode `0400` files below
`/var/lib/muncho-production-legacy-cutover/staged/host/`:

- the production gateway unit and normal GPT-5.6 production config;
- the Canonical Writer unit;
- the exact-SHA-rendered privileged Discord connector unit;
- the reviewed gateway `BindsTo`/Relay/`UnsetEnvironment` drop-in; and
- the numeric-ID-rendered production `guild_acl` connector JSON config (the
  separate synthetic canary config remains `public_only`);
- the Phase-B, route-back, macOS edge, browser, and isolated-worker units and
  configs; and
- every credential-scoped operational-edge unit and config plus the exact
  root-owned client map; and
- the root-only API bearer and approval verifiers.

The plan's self-hashed `host_transition` binds each staged and target path,
SHA-256, owner, group, mode, and exact pre-state. The gateway target service
identity also binds the drop-in path and digest. The generated executable
independently requires the connector unit to be an exact rendering of the
packaged reviewed template, requires the drop-in bytes to equal the packaged
source, validates the connector JSON's exact shape, mode, guild/root-channel/
user/role ID lists, and rejects Discord credential names in the staged gateway
unit or config.

### Two-stage host authority

The initial collector intentionally has no owner-authored input. It can report
only facts already observable on the production host: the verified release and
artifact bindings, the three current service identities, the legacy snapshot,
the cron inventory, and mechanical-rail host/package facts. It therefore
cannot safely invent the three target service identities, the target host
transition, the capability topology, or the owner-reviewed cron continuity
plan. Those are exactly the fields needed to turn an observation into full
cutover authority.

The release manifest now carries a self-hashed host-artifact contract covering
the exact manifest-derived host transition. Static runtime payloads have
their final byte digests sealed by the release package, and the reviewed static
gateway connector drop-in contributes one more package digest. The remaining
production-rendered unit/config outputs and root-only verifier files
depend on owner-controlled live inputs, so packaging cannot truthfully know
their final bytes. Instead, the owner submits one canonical, self-hashed host
plan to the fixed read-only host-authority collector. That collector verifies
the release contract, reads back every fixed staged file, compares every
target pre-states, validates the topology and executable cron plan, and returns
the full per-file evidence plus its aggregate digest. Any omitted, extra,
changed, wrongly owned, wrongly permissioned, or package-mismatched file fails
closed.

The owner-side workflow composes the initial and host receipts, signs the
resulting freeze authority locally, and only then performs its first mutation:
staging that signed freeze publication. Its order is fixed as initial
collection, host-authority collection, authority composition, freeze signing,
freeze staging, final-tail capture, stopped-state collection, cutover-plan
staging, Phase-B preflight, and apply. Before a cutover plan is staged, a
failure invokes the fixed `abort-freeze` recovery path. The private signing key
is never passed to the production transport.

The isolated-canary prerequisite is not hand-authored JSON. Build it from the
four immutable canonical public receipts with the edge author:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.owner_gate_release_author \
  author-isolated-canary-prerequisite \
  --release-revision <exact-40-character-release-sha> \
  --fixture /absolute/immutable/fixture.json \
  --workspace-gateway /absolute/immutable/workspace-gateway.json \
  --cleanup-receipt /absolute/immutable/cleanup-receipt.json \
  --production-diff /absolute/immutable/production-diff.json
```

It reuses the production validator, derives the fixture digest itself, and
publishes only to the fixed mode-`0444` owner path
`~/.hermes/owner-gate-production-cutover/isolated-canary-prerequisites/<release-sha>.json`.
There is no output-path argument.

### Fixed host-authority plan production

The owner launcher does not accept the seven semantic host-authority fields as
JSON. Signed v3 unit inputs bind the exact identities, distinct public key IDs,
and the reviewed legacy-to-target Discord policy reconciliation. The fixed
root-side producer then:

- re-verifies the immutable release and renders or copies every contracted host
  artifact to its fixed create-only staging path;
- records only public verifier/key identities and never secret content or a
  secret digest;
- derives live user/group, target-file, token/passkey metadata, lease-directory,
  service-target, topology, and transition facts; and
- copies the initial collector's already owner-approved cron continuity plan
  byte-for-byte into the exact seven-field host-authority plan.

`stage-host-artifacts` is inert and cleanly resumable only for exact bytes.
`collect-host-plan` is read-only. The downstream host-authority collector still
re-reads every staged file, rejects target or boot drift, and binds the result
to the signed FreezePlan. Caller-authored `host_transition`, target identity,
or `capability_topology` remains outside the authority boundary.

If a newer release authority is approved before freeze/cutover begins, the
create-only set is not overwritten or deleted. The fixed
`production_cutover_host_staging_rotation` successor transaction acquires the
same production activation lease, rejects any staged freeze/cutover authority,
verifies every predecessor byte against its self-hashed receipt, atomically
archives the predecessor host directory and receipt below the digest-addressed
rotation root, and invokes the exact successor producer. A crash leaves either
the predecessor intact or a resumable inert transaction; it never starts,
stops, or reloads a production service. The predecessor remains available for
audit after successor readback succeeds.

### Executable owner cutover sequence

The public owner CLI exposes only `prepare-cutover` and `resume-cutover` for
this transition. The remote action names described elsewhere in this document
are sealed implementation steps; do not invoke them as substitute owner CLI
actions. Create the output parent first as an owner-only directory. Every
`--workspace`, `--output`, key, and prerequisite path passed below must be
absolute.

First prepare the exact freeze authority and the passkey-v2 request without
staging the freeze publication:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  prepare-cutover \
  --revision <exact-40-character-release-sha> \
  --legacy-predecessor-revision \
    f5ece3598efba6635e661aaa509d783fa2d802d8 \
  --isolated-canary-goal-prerequisite \
    /absolute/owner-only/cutover/isolated-canary-prerequisite.json \
  --owner-private-key /absolute/owner-only/cutover-owner-ed25519 \
  --truth-mode start_new_truth_epoch \
  --output \
    /absolute/owner-only/cutover/00-awaiting-bridge-bootstrap.json
```

The initial bootstrap accepts only that exact legacy f5 predecessor, a
strictly newer descendant release, and the owner-selected
`start_new_truth_epoch` mode. There is no accepted-event input and no prose
classification, inference, or reseed path. A successful prepare output has
state `awaiting_bridge_bootstrap`.

Advance exactly one durable state at a time. The first resume asks the legacy
passkey verifier for the narrowly bound approval needed to install the
temporary v2 approval bridge:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  resume-cutover \
  --revision <same-exact-release-sha> \
  --workspace \
    /absolute/owner-only/cutover/00-awaiting-bridge-bootstrap.json \
  --output /absolute/owner-only/cutover/01-awaiting-bridge-passkey.json
```

Verify that the new workspace state is `awaiting_bridge_passkey`, review its
exact bridge bindings, then open only its
`bridge_request.legacy_approval_url`. Emil must approve that exact legacy
bridge action with the legacy passkey. A chat approval, SSH key, TOTP, or the
later v2 approval is not a substitute.

After the legacy bridge approval, consume it and atomically install the
fixed, v2-only approval bridge:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  resume-cutover \
  --revision <same-exact-release-sha> \
  --workspace /absolute/owner-only/cutover/01-awaiting-bridge-passkey.json \
  --output /absolute/owner-only/cutover/02-awaiting-cutover-passkey.json
```

Verify state `awaiting_cutover_passkey`. Only this workspace may advertise the
already-bound v2 URL in `advertised_approval_url`. Open that exact URL and have
Emil approve the complete release, FreezePlan, transaction, and action payload
with the v2 passkey. Do not approve a copied request ID or a newly constructed
URL.

The next resume consumes that single-use v2 grant and durably records the
claim, but does not yet stage the freeze authority:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  resume-cutover \
  --revision <same-exact-release-sha> \
  --workspace /absolute/owner-only/cutover/02-awaiting-cutover-passkey.json \
  --output /absolute/owner-only/cutover/03-passkey-claim-recorded.json
```

Verify state `passkey_claim_recorded`. The fourth resume uses that recorded
claim to stage the freeze authority, capture and bind the final tail and
stopped services, stage cron continuity, author and stage the cutover plan,
and durably publish every receipt needed by convergence:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  resume-cutover \
  --revision <same-exact-release-sha> \
  --workspace /absolute/owner-only/cutover/03-passkey-claim-recorded.json \
  --output /absolute/owner-only/cutover/04-cutover-staged.json
```

Verify state `cutover_staged`. The fifth and final resume invokes the fixed,
idempotent internal `converge-cutover` root action, then the bootstrap-only
`TARGET_ACTIVE` observer. It writes an activation receipt and recurrent
predecessor-trust envelope only after the immutable root-owned/read-only target
proves the complete 79-unit catalog. It never calls or emulates recurrent
Stage-C `PREDECESSOR_ACTIVE`:

```bash
python -m scripts.canary.production_cutover_owner_launcher \
  resume-cutover \
  --revision <same-exact-release-sha> \
  --workspace /absolute/owner-only/cutover/04-cutover-staged.json \
  --output /absolute/owner-only/cutover/05-cutover-terminal.json
```

Terminalization additionally requires the exact recurrent v4 unit-input
triplet to be present at the live staged paths: `unit-input-plan.json` and
`unit-input-approval.json` are root-owned mode `0400`, and
`production-unit-inputs.json` is root-owned mode `0444`. The release package's
cutover v4 input document must equal the fixed document's canonical
`project_fixed_inputs_to_cutover_v4` projection. The terminal predecessor
trust uses the v4 plan hash, approval hash, and the fixed document's embedded
`fixed_inputs_sha256`; the bootstrap FreezePlan and approval remain separately
bound activation authority.

The output writer is create-only. It accepts an existing file only for a
byte-identical replay and otherwise fails with `owner_cutover_output_conflict`.
Never reuse an output filename for a different input workspace, state, retry,
or release. The next command always reads the preceding immutable output and
writes a new absolute filename; never redirect stdout over a workspace. If an
approval window expires, preserve the whole chain and start a fresh
`prepare-cutover` chain under fresh filenames.

Recovery follows the durable boundary, not operator guesswork:

| Durable state | Allowed recovery/convergence |
| --- | --- |
| No `cutover_staged` workspace, with no `freeze_aborted` terminal | A failure after freeze publication but before cutover-plan staging invokes the fixed internal `abort-freeze`. It may restore only the exact legacy services and Caddy bytes proven by the signed pre-state. If recovery is still incomplete, preserve the workspace and journals while reconciling only through the same fixed owner surface. |
| Any validated `freeze_aborted` terminal, before or after cutover-plan staging | The frozen attempt is closed. Preserve its immutable workspace and journals, then start a fresh `prepare-cutover` and approval chain under fresh filenames. The same `03-passkey-claim-recorded.json` or `04-cutover-staged.json` attempt cannot be retried into a new admissible freeze. |
| `cutover_staged`, before `activation_commit_intent` | The fifth `resume-cutover` calls the fixed `converge-cutover` state machine. Its signed pre-intent replay may finish the approved apply or restore the exact legacy/database/host/Caddy preimages. Before a cutover `passkey_intent`, `abort-freeze` is valid only through the maintenance-proven Caddy restore handoff; after a cutover `passkey_intent`, the cutover transaction must first produce its validated `rollback_terminal` and must not call `abort-freeze`. Never run a loose rollback command. |
| Pre-intent recovery terminalized as `cutover_rolled_back_restored` | The approved attempt is closed and cannot resume forward apply. Preserve the immutable workspace and both journals, then start a fresh `prepare-cutover` and approval chain under fresh filenames. Do not retry the same fifth-stage workspace expecting it to activate. |
| `activation_commit_intent` durable | The boundary is forward-only. Repeated fifth-stage `resume-cutover` calls from the immutable `04-cutover-staged.json`, each with a new absolute output, may converge only to verified `private_v2_active` or the persistent fixed 503 `maintenance_active` floor. They must never restore or route to v1. |

If either resume fails without creating its output, preserve the input
workspace and every remote journal before choosing the next action from the
durable state above. Retry the same fifth-stage workspace with a new absolute
recovery-attempt output only when recovery is incomplete or the transaction is
already forward-only. A completed `freeze_aborted` or
`cutover_rolled_back_restored` recovery instead requires a fresh
`prepare-cutover` and approval chain; the old workspace remains evidence. The
recorded claim is validated for replay only within an admissible retry and the
passkey is not consumed again. If a terminal output reports
`caddy_outcome=maintenance_active`, v1 remains forbidden and the evidence must
be preserved while forward convergence continues through the same fixed owner
surface. There is no public owner `recover` or `converge` subcommand:
`converge-cutover` is an internal root action reached only by
`resume-cutover`; do not invoke it directly.

### Rollback authority boundary

Rollback has four deliberately separate phases:

1. Before a cutover plan has been staged, `abort-freeze` may restart only the
   exact legacy gateway that the freeze stopped. It must attest that database
   authority, host state, tokens, and Caddy were never changed.
2. After plan staging but before a cutover `passkey_intent`, `abort-freeze` is
   valid only inside `converge-cutover` after Caddy has durably published the
   exact maintenance/public-503 restore handoff. The abort receipt binds that
   handoff and cutover plan; exact legacy Caddy bytes may be restored only after
   the gateway abort is terminal.
3. After a cutover `passkey_intent` but before the fsynced
   `activation_commit_intent`, the signed cutover transaction performs its own
   exact preimage rollback for the approved database, host, token, and service
   changes and publishes a validated `rollback_terminal`. Caddy is recovered
   by its separate signed journal/state machine only after that terminal;
   `abort-freeze` is not valid on this path.
4. The fsynced `activation_commit_intent` is the irreversible forward-only
   authority boundary. Recovery after it must never restore or route to v1.
   It may only converge to verified v2 or to the fixed 503 maintenance route
   while preserving the v2 authority database and mutation journal, followed
   by forward recovery.

The existing `muncho-auto-deploy-release run <SHA> <PR>` action remains valid
only before cutover while the loaded production unit still uses the legacy
mutable-release symlink topology. It is a reversible pre-cutover deploy, not a
cutover stage action and not a launch blocker. Once the SHA-pinned cutover
identity or any ambiguous cutover state is present, that helper remains
fail-closed; no new stage-only variant is introduced.

This layer deliberately does not invent a production gateway `ExecStart`.
The production model-sovereignty startup-contract renderer must supply the
normal GPT-5.6 agent loop + API/Relay + Canonical Writer target unit/config;
neither the writer-only `--require-canonical-writer` contract nor the bounded
`--require-capability-canary` contract is a valid production substitute. Its
exact output is handed to this layer through:

- `host_transition.files.gateway_unit` at staged
  `.../staged/host/hermes-cloud-gateway.service`; and
- `host_transition.files.gateway_config` at staged
  `.../staged/host/config.yaml`.

Host apply requires gateway, writer, and connector stopped. Before the first
replacement it records exact root-only backups for every target file. It
then installs only the signed bytes, atomically moves the ordinary-session
Discord credential from the plan's exact stopped-gateway source lease to the
connector-owned one-link mode-`0400` target, proves every other gateway token
path absent, and proves the separate route-back-only lease remains non-gateway
owned. Token content and token digests are never emitted or journaled. A crash
with source and target both present is resumable only when their bytes compare
equal internally; the source is retired before an apply receipt is possible.

The same stopped action re-reads every sealed operational helper and manifest,
installs the exact pre-staged Ed25519 receipt-key pairs, and starts only the
credential-scoped operational-edge services under the reboot fence. It proves
distinct non-root service UIDs/GIDs and distinct per-domain
socket groups, every systemd fragment, each Unix socket owner/group/mode, and a
fresh boot-bound readiness receipt collected through the real signed socket
protocol. Every service is a member of only its own socket group; its config
admits only the gateway UID, its state directory is mode `0700`, and its
systemd credential projection contains only that domain's leases. The root
publisher drops the probe subprocess to the gateway UID/GID with exactly the
manifest-derived client groups—never to an edge identity—so a compromised edge cannot
invoke a sibling socket or read a sibling state/credential projection.
Gateway, writer, Discord connector, and the normal prerequisite services remain
stopped throughout this isolated canary gate.

The precommit host actions start only the 16 local/dormant long-running
services and the Phase-B startup oneshot; all 30 socket/timer triggers remain
disabled. The writer starts and reaches database postflight while both public
ingress services—the Discord connector and gateway—remain stopped. After the
durable activation commit intent, the host boot action starts the connector;
the coordinator accepts its exact readiness and then starts the gateway. The
connector is not a local-only prerequisite, and Caddy's web-ingress receipt is
not Discord Gateway evidence. The gateway alone is in the voice-protected set,
while connector and gateway are both in the public-ingress/session-drain set.
Terminal evidence requires all 18 long-running services active, the Phase-B
oneshot active/exited, and all 30 triggers enabled under the exact target
unit/drop-in identities.

The same cutover package now carries the existing three-unit alias-projection
rail. Its preflight, install, and postflight run while gateway, writer, and
connector are stopped; rollback restores its byte-exact prestate before any
terminal authority. Only after writer, connector, and gateway activation does
the coordinator issue the alias activation authority, start the exporter and
projector, and enable the projector timer. The alias package and activation
receipts are bound into the cutover terminal and initial activation receipt.

Rollback requires all three services stopped, accepts only exact target or
already-restored file identities, restores every exact backup, moves the
ordinary-session token back to its exact pre-cutover owner/path without
recording it, reloads systemd, and proves all three legacy identities stopped.
It is intentionally fail-closed. The rollback contract sets
`restart_legacy_gateway=true`, but only after exact legacy host/database
identities have been restored and the DM-safe legacy boundary has been
revalidated.

Rollback also stops and removes the exact operational-edge units, removes
the published readiness receipt, and verifies that both staged and final key
copies remain exact but dormant. It never regenerates, replaces, exports, or
deletes those private keys. The service identities and socket groups
remain dormant, with every pre-existing membership restored and no cross-domain
membership widening.

## Cron continuity and mechanical rail

The read-only initial receipt also binds the exact legacy cron inventory,
redaction-safe root metadata for `/usr/bin/gh`, `/usr/bin/git`, and the GitHub
credential file, plus the exact release-addressed mechanical-job package
manifest. No credential value, size, or digest is recorded. Before a freeze
plan can be authored, the owner continuity plan must account for every exact
record. The legacy upstream-sync job may only be replaced by the matching
packaged rail manifest; a blanket inert migration is non-executable. The
cutover authority refuses to stop production unless the reviewed continuity
plan is explicitly executable.

If the four installed rail units still point at already-retired immutable
release roots, use only the public `owner-run` successor path in
`scripts.canary.upstream_sync_rail_successor_rebind`. It accepts the exact
target and predecessor revisions plus the reviewed package, Stage-C host
manifest, Stage-C release publication, and rebind-runtime SHA-256 identities.
It accepts no paths, commands, JSON document, prose, secret, or alternate
target. The release-pinned owner runtime carries one framed request over the
fixed production IAP identity. Root first verifies the fixed Stage-C public
files, package, release sources, runtime byte identity, predecessor unit bytes,
systemd state, and missing retired roots in memory. Only then may it create the
fixed root-owned authority and preflight files; the existing rebind/verify
journal remains the sole runtime mutation path. Exact replay resumes a partial
stage or transaction, while foreign bytes, ownership, mode, symlink, or
hard-link drift fail closed.

## Live prerequisites

Packaging closes the missing executable boundary but does not fabricate live
facts. Before production execution, collect and owner-review:

1. the release manifest and six exact artifact digests;
2. the stopped final-tail receipt and exact Cloud SQL target/TLS identity;
3. an exact least-privilege migration owner, writer role, and enabled writer
   login with no unrelated authority;
4. the root-only CA/password transport and every staged host target file;
5. the reviewed production model-sovereignty gateway unit/config producer and
   exact SHA-bound output (writer-only/canary startup modes are forbidden);
6. connector user/group, credential directory, pre-initialized connector
   journal, exact ordinary-token source lease, and distinct preserved
   route-back-only lease;
7. trusted preflight evidence for every remaining non-file host prerequisite;
8. an exhaustive owner-reviewed cron continuity plan and matching mechanical
   rail package manifest;
9. successful clean-room and production-shaped canary evidence; and
10. a fresh out-of-band signature over the final cutover plan.

The cutover authority v3 embeds the isolated-canary prerequisite v2 rather
than accepting a terminal digest by itself. The owner signature therefore
binds the complete reviewed fixture, signed goal-continuation gateway
envelope, signed cleanup observer envelope, and canonical native
`production-diff.json`. The verifier rechecks the cleanup receipt's native
`production_diff_observation` binding and requires the same diff digest in the
terminal, cleanup receipt, run, release, fixture, capability plan, full-canary
plan, and owner approval. Legacy prerequisite shapes and missing evidence have
no compatibility bypass.

Promotion also requires byte-exact equality for the semantic configuration,
ordered toolsets, and capability-role/service topology. Only the reviewed
canary-versus-production Discord channel ID is mechanically normalized; guild,
roles, service units, model route, `goals.max_turns=0`, Kanban-off policy,
privileged-writer boundary, and DM/direct-Discord prohibitions must remain
exact.

The two no-mutation statements are intentionally separate. The owner-bound
native canary diff proves zero production mutation before production cutover
intent. After host files, cron continuity, and prerequisite services are
staged, those production lifecycle mutations are explicitly acknowledged; the
pre-database receipt v2 claims only
`canonical_database_mutation_observed=false`, backed by the stopped writer,
unchanged frozen legacy snapshot, and still-legacy schema. Database apply
cannot run until that receipt and `capability_prerequisites_validated` are in
the append-only journal.

No production service, database, secret, or Cloud resource is changed by the
packager or its tests.
