# Muncho owner gate foundation

This directory is the inert, offline-deployable foundation for the dedicated
private `muncho-owner-gate-01` VM.  It does not authorize a Cloud mutation and
does not switch `auth.lomliev.com`.

The VM uses three fixed no-shell identities.  `muncho-passkey-web` can only
serve the public WebAuthn UI and reach the authority Unix socket.  It cannot
read the SQLite authority database, consume a grant, or reach the metadata
server.  `muncho-passkey-authority` owns the SQLite database, runs without a
network namespace, verifies the exact WebAuthn assertion, and can reach only
the executor Unix socket.  `muncho-storage-executor` cannot read the authority
database; it owns only `/var/lib/muncho-owner-gate/executor`, whose canonical
SQLite execution ledger is the append-only mutation journal, and is the sole
non-root UID allowed to reach instance metadata and the private Google API VIP.

The release is transferred over IAP as a complete offline artifact, installed
root-owned beneath `/opt/muncho-owner-gate/releases/<revision>`, and sealed
read-only.  No `apt`, `pip`, public IP, service-account key, generic shell, or
local `gcloud` fallback is part of runtime execution.  The dedicated subnet is
in `ai-platform-vpc`, uses `10.80.3.0/28`, and enables Private Google Access.
The plan must freshly prove that CIDR does not overlap any subnet, route,
peering, or connector range before creation.

`auth.lomliev.com` and Caddy remain on `ai-platform-runtime-01`.  Only after
offline split-UID, WebAuthn, concurrency, metadata-firewall, and no-op executor
smoke may Caddy atomically reload the private upstream template.  The old v1
unit is masked before cutover.  Once the public-key-only credential migration
has committed, v1 can never be re-enabled; rollback becomes a fail-closed
maintenance response while the v2 authority database and mutation journal are
preserved.

The mutation IAM binding is a second gate.  Bootstrap creates no usable Cloud
mutation authority.  The deferred custom-role binding is resource-conditioned
to the exact canary disk and instance. Completion is observed by polling those
same conditioned resources; no zonal-operation permission is granted. It is
allowed only after all v2 security smoke receipts are valid.

The final storage-executor activation is a separate root-only command and is
not called by bootstrap.  It accepts no paths, digests, or resource names.  It
revalidates the release-signed foundation/apply lineage, every installed
package payload, the exact owner-gate VM topology receipt, the split-UID/offline
security smoke, and the post-binding IAM/API/numeric-target re-preflight from
the fixed root-owned evidence directory.  It also requires a new canonical,
release-key-signed owner reauthentication receipt issued after that
re-preflight and still fresh at activation; its release and project number
must match the immutable lineage.  The executor-readable
`/etc/muncho-owner-gate/storage-executor-enabled` file is itself the complete
canonical authorization record: its self-hash covers the signed release
manifest, source tree, package inventory, terminal foundation-apply receipt,
both owner reauthentications, ancestry, numeric VM/targets, smoke, post-IAM
receipt, and every fixed evidence-file digest.  It is published as root, group
`muncho-storage-executor`, mode `0440`, using an fsynced no-replace protocol;
only after that complete record exists is a root-only append-only audit mirror
published under `activation-receipts`.  A seal-only interrupted recovery never
receives a freshness waiver.  A fully published exact replay is idempotent;
any stale, missing, symlinked, or divergent artifact fails closed.

Bootstrap and runtime IAP are separate surfaces.  The owner-side bootstrap
transport may invoke only the package-pinned stage-zero entrypoint; the normal
IAP intake exists only after installation and accepts fixed JSON on stdin for
the authority UID.  Before any venv code runs, stage zero verifies the stable
fork-pinned release signer with Debian OpenSSL, the canonical manifest, and
every package byte.  The runtime lock and signed package bind one exact
bootstrap-pip wheel separately from the 22 target wheels.  Stage zero creates
the venv with `--without-pip`, executes only that carried wheel under
`-I -S -B` and an exact standard-library path, and installs itself plus the
target closure with no network, dependencies, source builds, or bytecode
compilation.  The mutable host `/usr/share/python-wheels` directory is never an
authority or execution input.  It also proves `venv --without-pip` and required
systemd helpers locally; it never downloads a package.  Bootstrap never edits the
machine-wide `/etc/hosts`.  Instead it installs one exact root-owned, mode-0444,
single-link file at `/etc/muncho-owner-gate/compute-api-hosts`, containing only
the three `199.36.153.8` mappings for `compute.googleapis.com`,
`cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com`, and `iam.googleapis.com`.  Only the
privileged executor receives that file as its read-only `/etc/hosts` via
systemd `BindReadOnlyPaths`; every other owner-gate service masks the source
path.  Installation is byte-identical on replay, and rollback removes only
that exact managed path after digest, owner, mode, link-count, and symlink
checks, leaving all unrelated host state untouched.
